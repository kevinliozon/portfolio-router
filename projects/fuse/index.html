<h2>Fuse Universal: How to save a product</h2>

<p>All the experiences I talk about below happened while I was being employed at Fuse Universal</p>

<h4>Themes</h4>
<p>Gathering a community of practices for defining our design system</p>
<h4>The project</h4>
<p>Setting standards, practices and processes that work for the team and other departments in order to serve the end user.</p>
<h4>My role</h4>
<p>Has varied over time. From creating our design system to spreading the best practices for maintaining and documenting all our processes with a focus on transparency</p>
<h4>Collaborated with</h4>
<p>Our product design team's mambers, solution architects, external partners and clients</p>
<h4>The problem to solve</h4>
<p>
  "Fuse". This single word charged with cynicism and irony was sometimes used here and there to point out a design and engineering flaw with our platform.
  This inside joke makes everybody chuckle and to be honest I could not help myself too.
</p>
<p>
  However the problem with cynicism is it gives the impression we are acting against a problem while we provide literally no solution indeed.
  Our team could have comfortably sat and play some lyre while the city was burning however we knew we could do better than that.
</p>
<p>
  Indeed Fuse is old. It is a SAAS platform which has come through several iterations since 2010. I cannot give more details about the stack for obvious reasons
  but I can at least tell you the technology used for the backoffice is almost dead (not just dying).
  Speaking of the back office, it gives the opportunity for us or the client to create their own custom widgets via micro-frontends approach with their very own code...
  This detail is important because our company tended to litteraly overrelying on this type of offer.
</p>
<p>
  Design inconsistencies were also rampant because every feature was developed by different squads with almost no common practice and standards between each of them.
</p>
<p>
  You probably see from a mile away all the complications this setup can bring upon.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Design inconsistencies due to a heavy history and lack of collaboration.</li>
  <li>Several accessibility issues.</li>
  <li>The overreliance on custom widgets (as micro-frontends) and untested overrides (such as embedding the client's font) could impact performance and accessibility.</li>
  <li>Different practices from developer to developer and from designer to designer leading to many abuses of grey areas.</li>
  <li>A lack of common vocabulary between actors ending up with many misinterpreations and communications issues.</li>
  <li>Either no documentation or in the best case scenario some obsolete ones.</li>
  <li>Our team was owning a pretty niche knowledge but other departments were depending too much on us. Conflicting with our task of making the platform better.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How did we solve it?</h4>
<p>
  Not an easy exercise to sum up 3 years with the constraints related to writing for the web therefore I will break this down in milestones.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Building a community of practices around the way we design and build our components: <a class="nav__link" href="#page=projects/fuse/fuse-designsystem" target="_top" data-template="/projects/fuse/fuse-designsystem">Read about how we created our design system</a></li>
  <li>Narrowing down our offer of custom widgets via a catalogue of our most accessibility-tested and performance savvy ones: <a class="nav__link" href="#page=projects/project1" target="_top" data-template="/projects/project1">Read about our client-facing documentation</a></li>
  <li>Documenting our process with transparency for the team, our solutions architects, our consultants and our partners: <a class="nav__link" href="#page=projects/project1" target="_top" data-template="/projects/project1">Read about our internal process documentation</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>The results? (more details in the dedicated page of the sub projects above)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>This approach has led to a significant decrease in bug tickets and amends requests</li>
  <li>Projects can be smoothly delegated from one team member to another without any frictions or conflicts since our practices are aligned</li>
  <li>Solution architects, consultants and partners don't need to rely on us anymore for sertain tasks since they can easily build prototypes from our design systems and customise documentations</li>
  <li>This saved us more time for focusing on more strategic goals and also resource related cost because we are able to delegate</li>
</ul>
