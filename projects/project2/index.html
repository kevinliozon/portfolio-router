<h2>Fuse Universal: Building an user centred culture</h2>

<p>All the experiences I talk about below happened while I was being employed at Fuse Universal</p>

<h4>Themes</h4>
<p>Gathering a community of practices for defining our design system</p>
<h4>The project</h4>
<p>Setting out practices and processes that work for the team and other departments</p>
<h4>My role</h4>
<p>Has varied over time. From creating our design system to spreading the best practices for maintaining and documenting all our processes with a focus on transparency</p>
<h4>Collaborated with</h4>
<p>Our product design team's mambers, solution architects, external partners and clients</p>
<h4>The problem to solve</h4>
<p>
  "Fuse". This single word charged with cynicism and irony was sometimes used here and there to point out a design and engineering flaw with our platform.
  This inside joke makes everybody chuckle and to be honest I could not help myself too.
</p>
<p>
  However the problem with cynicism is it gives the impression we are acting against a problem while we provide literally no solution indeed.
  Our team could have comfortably sat and play some lyre while the city was burning however we knew we could do better than that.
</p>
<p>
  Indeed Fuse is old. It is a SAAS platform which has come through several iterations since 2010. I cannot give more details about the stack for obvious reasons
  but I can at least tell you the technology used for the backoffice is almost dead (not just dying).
  Speaking of the back office, it gives the opportunity to us or the client to create their own custom widgets via micro-frontends approach with their very own code... this detail will be important for what comes next.
</p>
<p>
  You probably see from a a mile away all the complications this setup can bring upon.
  <ul>
    <li>Design inconsistencies due to an overflexible approach to customisation</li>
    <li>Different practices from developer to developer and from designer to designer leading to many abuses of grey areas.</li>
    <li>A lack of common vocabulary between actors ending up with many misinterpreations and communications issues</li>
    <li>Either no documentation or in the best case scenario some obsolete ones</li>
    <li>Our team was owning a pretty niche knowledge but other departments were depending too much on us. Conflicting with our task of making the platform better</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h4>How did we solve it?</h4>
<p>
  It is a really hard exercise to convey an almost 3 years story through the standards of writing for the web
</p>
<h4>The results?</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Solution architects don't need to rely on us anymore for updating or setting up the colour scheme of a client's instance</li>
    <li>This saved us more time for focusing on more strategic goals and also resource related cost because this step only involves solution architects from now on</li>
</ul>
