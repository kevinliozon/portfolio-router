<h1>Service minded product designer and team facilitator</h1>

<main>
    <h2>Want to make a product or feature real?</h2>
    <p>
        My experience in both ideating and building applications but also in extending functionalities from existing ones is my best tool.
        The part I love about my job is seeing an idea emerge and materialise physically (or rather digitally) while being involved in each step of the process.

        I am product designer but I like coding. Yes I do. My understanding of front-end technologies makes I do not only focus on the visual aspect of accessibility
        but also its technical aspect (implementation, equipments and browser compatibility). Also I am a strong advocate for performance optimisation in order
        to improve the user experience.

    <p>
        My academic training in design and management definitely kickstarted my career but I keep on harnessing my skills. Therefore I also certified with the UX research leader
        <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/" target="_blank">Nielsen & Norman Group</a> and in accessibility

    <h2>Need to make your creative team's life easier?</h2>
    <p>
        My desire to be involved in each step of the process does not mean I like to micro-manage each of them and falling in the trap of my own biases. I strongly believe each team member
        should be involved and we can only benefit from the skillset of everybody.
    </p>
    <p>My journey at leading a team made of talented product designers, front-end developers and technical writers gave me the nuts and bolts of making design processes looking like seamless</p>

    <h2>Making right things or making things right?</h2>
    <p>There is a right balance between creativity and technical focus. However this is not an easy one to strike.</p>
    <p>My past tenures as product designer and frontend developer help me a lot at being creative while keeping it down to earth.</p>
