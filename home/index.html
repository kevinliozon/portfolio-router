<h2>Service minded product designer and team facilitator</h2>
<p>
  I can help you with scaling your product from its definition to its release and user adoption.
  The commercial experiences I have gathered from several industries, various types and sizes of projects as well as risk and change management exposure,
  could be the missing piece to get your project on track.
</p>
<h3>Here are some areas I can give you a hand with</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Building efficient design systems that will save you time and effort down the line</li>
  <li>Optimising processes for design and implementation</li>
  <li>Ensuring product delivery that complies with the blueprint</li>
  <li>Change management within product teams</li>
  <li>Risk management with clients</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Looking for some help or input?</h2>
  <p>
      Let's cut short with the usual portfolio memorabilia/throwback. You are here because you need a problem to get solved or an input.
      Hopefully the list below will describe a situation similar to yours and give you an idea of how I can help you at finding solutions.
      Each case study is divided in more specific ones that answer very defined issues in case you are coming across a similar one.

    <h3>My product has been around for a while and has not been initially built with a design and user driven approach.</h3>
    <p>
      There is no shame about this. Many businesses are in the same court. 
      Let's be honnest though, this can be a tough situation because it will not only require to compromise with a lot of technical debts and restrictions
      but we also naturally tend to prefer working on new shiny things rather than refurbishing old rusty ones.
      However this kind of challenge is probably one of those that helped me to learn the most and realise the importance of scalability and having clear processess in place.
    </p>
    <p>Let me show you how we turned the tide at Fuse Universal by moving away from our old ways and solved several design related fairly common problems</p>

    <h3>I need to start a project and I would like to make sure its design is scalable from the beginning</h3>
    <p>
      There is no overthinking in trying to get things done properly from start. It will turn out to be quite a relief on the long run indeed.
      One of the most exciting project I worked on was an insuretech IoT mobile application for Lloyds Banking Group and Halifax.
      Innovative projects especially can evolve in unexpected ways and we often have to deal with several trade offs.
    </p>
    <p>Here I will prove you how properly defining the user's need from the beginning paired with a consistent and device coherent design system can reduce these negative impacts.</p>

    <h3>I need to start and R&D or MVP project and I would like to make sure its design is scalable from the beginning</h3>
    <p>
      There is no overthinking in trying to get things done properly from start. It will turn out to be quite a relief on the long run indeed.
      One of the most exciting project I worked on was an insuretech oriented IoT mobile app for Lloyds Banking Group and Halifax. Innovative projects can evolve in an unpredictible
      way and we often have to deal with trade offs.
    </p>
    <p>Here I will prove you how a consistent design system can reduce the negative impacts of the latter.</p>

    <p>This project for BAE system below is slightly different but will show you how a solid design system can give you a head start even though the brand guidelines have not been provided by the client.</p>

    <h3>We have this long time client we made a lot of promises to in the past. However these promises are now holding us back in delivering what we believe is the best for them.</h3>
    <p>
      An old implementation has got out of control? You want to convince the client that you can offer better but it will require to sacrifice some features they liked?
      Sometimes they can be understanding if you present the right arguments, still it is a very complicated exercise.

    <p>How we helped moving IHG from one of our most heavily customised solution to a more consistent and accessibility compliant design system during their rebrand</p>
    <a href="" target="_blank">A case study: IHG</a>
    <p>Pretty similar case as above with Migros</p>
    <a href="" target="_blank">A case study: IHG</a>
    <p>Dropbox wanted more accessibility, the branding they wanted prevented us to deliver. Here is how we found a middle ground.</p>

    <h3>We want our client or partner to take ownership of the platform we delivered to them and adopt its tools.</h3>
    <p>
      Engaging a stakeholder (individual or group) and making him confident enough with the tools you provide to them can be more or less challenging.
      It is often down to a case by case basis however it is always good practice to provide enough documentation and guidance for not putting off anybody with our solution
    </p>
    <p>In the following example I will be showing how we empirically developed insightful documentations at Fuse that cover even the most complex aspects of our platform's backoffice</p>

      I am product designer but I like coding. Yes I do. My understanding of front-end technologies makes I do not only focus on the visual aspect of accessibility
      but also its technical aspect (implementation, equipments and browser compatibility). Also I am a strong advocate for performance optimisation in order
      to improve the user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
      My academic training in design and management definitely kickstarted my career but I keep on harnessing my skills. Therefore I also certified with the UX research leader
      <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/" target="_blank">Nielsen & Norman Group</a> and in accessibility

    <h2>Want to make a product or feature real?</h2>
    <p>
        My experience in both ideating and building applications but also in extending functionalities from existing ones is my best tool.
        The part I love about my job is seeing an idea emerge and materialise physically (or rather digitally) while being involved in each step of the process.

    <h2>Need to make your creative team's life easier?</h2>
    <p>
        My desire to be involved in each step of the process does not mean I like to micro-manage each of them and falling in the trap of my own biases. I strongly believe each team member
        should be involved and we can only benefit from the skillset of everybody.
    </p>
    <p>My journey at leading a team made of talented product designers, front-end developers and technical writers gave me the nuts and bolts of making design processes looking like seamless</p>

    <h2>Making right things or making things right?</h2>
    <p>There is a right balance between creativity and technical focus. However this is not an easy one to strike.</p>
    <p>My past tenures as product designer and frontend developer help me a lot at being creative while keeping it down to earth.</p>
