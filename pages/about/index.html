<h1>About my values and ethics</h1>

    <h2>Involving everyone</h2>
    <p>
        Working on a new project or changing processes and practices can be challenging for teams.
        Thing are neither going to get done properly through a one-person effort nor with just assigning "resources" randomly.
    </p>
    <p>I believe we can get the best of a product by engaging every actor and making sure each individual realises his/her importance in the process.</p>

    <h2>Digital products should be accessible</h2>
    <p>
        Everybody, whatever there disability (even temporary) should have access to any resource on the web.
        This is a very ambitious exercise and all company do not always have the means to achieve it.
    </p>
    <p>
        However this should be a common endeavour to make sure as many people as possible can access our digital products.
        This is why I make sure we comply with the following standards when designing:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Accessibility: clear contrast (whatever the type of colour blindness), intuitive interface and interactions, adapting the information so it can be conveyed by a screend reader.</li>
        <li>Performance: By keeping things simple and not cluttering the interface with low relevance functionalities slowing down the rendering on slow connections (areas with poor Internet infrastructures)</li>
        <li>Privacy and Safety: Often overlooked by designers. Previous user feedbacks proved me one of their most reccurent fear was the lack of tranparency about how their data was processed and used. This often results in less engagement from them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Keeping up to date</h2>
    <p>I undergraduated in Webdesign and postgraduated in International Management because I wanted the best possible skillset to help teams at building their products.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IAE</li>
        <li>LP</li>
        <li>IUT</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        But I do not rest on these because I am well aware practices and knowledge are constently evolving.
        This is why I am regularly making sure to keep sharp by reading articles from renowned organisations in their fields.
    </p>
    <p>Passing certifications helps me further at making sure I am getting things right and bolstering my skills:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Nielsen and norman Group</li>
        <li>EDX</li>
        <li>Code school/pluralsight</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Scuba-diving shaped me the most as a professional</h2>
    <p>
        Scuba-diving is not just putting some gear and admiring some awesome shipwreck.
        This is also a full process from the moment we set foot on the boat with our dry feet to the moment we set foot again with our feet wet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having a plan is critical. Double checking all the equipment is operational is crucial and the slight mistake can not only put yourself at risk but also your whole group.
        Starting out as a teenager it not only taught me early to look after the people I am embarked with in my journey the same they would do for me
        but also to keep composed whatever the situation.
