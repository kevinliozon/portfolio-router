<h2>Writing technical documentation for the user</h2>

<p>All the experiences I talk about below happened while I was being employed at Fuse Universal</p>

<h4>Themes</h4>
<p>Documentation, delegation and developer experience</p>
<h4>The project</h4>
<p>Creating technical documentations that are accessible to help the user at getting onboard with our platform.</p>
<h4>My role</h4>
<p>Managing our technical writers and product designers in writing documentations. Making sure the technical details are clearly conveyed.</p>
<h4>Collaborated with</h4>
<p>Our product design team's members and solution architects</p>
<h4>The problem to solve</h4>
<p>
  Before getting further I would suggest you <a class="nav__link" href="#page=projects/fuse" target="_top" data-template="/projects/fuse">have a read about my contribution to Fuse</a>
  if you did not already. Because many of the reasons as to why we needed to provide technical documentation are layed out in this broader case study.
</p>
<p>
  The specificity of Fuse is to offer some advanced functionalities such as the possibility to our clients to create their own widgets or edit the ones we provide.
  Of course this offer comes with some caveats that need to be provided to the user.
  However, even for the most expert technical user, have you been already handed off a piece of software, that required coding knowledge without any explanation or tutorial?
  This is what has been done for years at Fuse and it was frustrating not only for the client but also for our colleagues involved in delivery and support processes.
</p>
<h4>How did we solve it?</h4>
<p>
  We created a client facing documentation that would help admin users to edit the widgets via code and manage their own library of asset with minimal technical training.
  Our solution architects' contribution has been critical here because they provided us with insightful feedbacks from our clients.
  This has not been a short term task and the approach as been mostly empirical. Therefore it has gone through several iterations in the following order:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A pretty basic version made with Google: Its flaws were of course it was not appealing and lacked visual representation</li>
  <li>Another one made with Sketch: Looked nicer and featured more visual representation however it required a subscription to Sketch and only us could write it because it was client specific (branded)</li>
  <li>Our latest version: Made with Figma, we kept the same type of layout as the Sketch but unbranded in order to allow the persons outside our team to tailor it for each client</li>
</ul>
<p>
  In parallel, I worked closely with our technical writer in order to make sure the design and technical specifics for our standard functionalities (non-customisable)
  were properly conveyed within our client-facing documentation in Confluence.
</p>
<h4>The results?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>We are able to provide our client with all the documentation they need whatever their technical skills.</li>
  <li>Our consultants and solutions architect can now quickly provide it without requiring our help and consequently our resources.</li>
  <li>Delivering handoff documentations that are nicely designed and written improves the customer experience. So far there have been no negative return from anybody since its roll out compared to our previous documentations.</li>
</ul>
