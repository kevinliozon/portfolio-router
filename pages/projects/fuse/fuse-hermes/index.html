<h2>Fuse Universal: A 36 days implementation</h2>

<p>All the experiences I talk about below happened while I was being employed at Fuse Universal</p>

<h4>Themes</h4>
<p>Design systems, branding, process</p>
<h4>The project</h4>
<p>Delivering a branded eLearning/social platform to the leading fashion brand Hermès Paris</p>
<h4>Targeted users</h4>
<p>Over 250 users</p>
<h4>My role</h4>
<p>Defining an accessibility compliant colour scheme from Hermès' brand guidelines and setting up their instance</p>
<h4>Collaborated with</h4>
<p>Solution architects and project managers</p>
<h4>The problem to solve</h4>
<p>
  Hermès Paris is a potential huge client. Even though the first launch targets only the middle eastern market (United Arab Emirates and Qatar), the outcome could
  lead us to win similar projects with their other regional divisions. The smaller scale of the project presented us with an opportunity to not only rolling out
  our new implementation process framework but also to showcase our ability to deliver quickly through a streamlined process to the client.
</p>
<p>
  Also the client did not provide much brand guidelines outside from some discovery phases prototypes, their assets and what we could interpret from their own website with
  the dev tools.
</p>
<h4>How did we solve it?</h4>
<p>
  This has been a cross-department effort and I would definitely state the synergy I had with the solution architect and project manager assigned to this project
  have turned it into a success. My design suggestions were conveyed and backed in such a way that I did not even need to get on a call with the client. The design deliverable required only
  a couple of amends and we have been able to proceed with the setup of the instance pretty quick.
</p>
<h4>The results?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The delivery process took 4 working days: The design phase took 2 days and the setup phase took 2 days as well</li>
  <li>If we include all the administrative procedures such as sales pitch, discovery phase, blueprint, contract and sign off. The whole project has taken 36 days</li>
  <li>No amends or bug fixes have been required after we delivered the build</li>
</ul>
