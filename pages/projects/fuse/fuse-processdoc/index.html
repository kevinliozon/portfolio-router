<h2>Writing for our teams</h2>

<p>All the experiences I talk about below happened while I was being employed at Fuse Universal</p>

<h4>Themes</h4>
<p>Process documentation, process optimisation, transparency and community of practices</p>
<h4>The project</h4>
<p>Streamlining our product delivery processes with 3 different teams.</p>
<h4>My role</h4>
<p>Defining, optimising and documenting the requirements and stages of different processes while assessing their inherent risks</p>
<h4>Collaborated with</h4>
<p>The implementation (solution architects), support and sales teams</p>
<h4>The problem to solve</h4>
<p>
  Before getting further I would suggest you <a class="nav__link js-link--content" href="#page=projects/fuse" target="_top" data-template="/projects/fuse">have a read about my contribution to Fuse</a>
  if you did not already. Because many of the reasons as to why we needed to redefine our processes are layed out in this broader case study.
</p>
<p>
  As the product design team, we are at the crossroad of several other departments therefore we need to be able to either answer any question related to the product or
  deliver a specific <dfn title="Setting up a client's project">implementation</dfn> or feature.
</p>
<p>
  Even though there were similarities between the deliverables we were providing for implementation works, sales pitches and redesign/rebrand requests (coming through support), there were still a few differences.
  Requirements and accountability were the most recurrent points of contentions and we needed to find a way to definitely to agree about these before putting them in writing.
</p>
<p>
  It was not the first time I attempted to document our processes and it mostly highlighted the fact each task was handled in very specific way. Either too lean or too procedural,
  it was common the team would get confused.
</p>
<h4>How did we solve it?</h4>
<p>
  The fact we were able to delegate the tasks of <a class="nav__link js-link--content" href="#page=projects/fuse/fuse-designsystem" target="_top" data-template="/projects/fuse/fuse-designsystem">easily prototyping</a>
  for clients and deliver them <a class="nav__link js-link--content" href="#page=projects/fuse/fuse-clientdoc" target="_top" data-template="/projects/fuse/fuse-clientdoc">instruction manuals</a>
  offered us a unique opportunity to homogeneise these processes.
</p>
<p>
  Indeed, apart from the fact we were still required to participate to ideation sessions with our solution architects and review their layouts, we could now focus on only setting up the product before realease.
  This step required a deeper understanding of the product and this was the only part we could not delegate easily. Therefore making sure all requirements were checked was crucial.
</p>
<p>
  In order to make sure everybody was doing his part, I came up writing 3 pieces of documentation for different departments
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The implementation team: aimed at solution architects and project managers.</li>
  <li>The support team: aimed at consultants/customer success managers.</li>
  <li>The lsales teams: aimed at pre-sales staffs in order to provide them with a lean deliverable for pitches.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Each of these "rulebooks" were written upon the same template and highlighted several areas of the process with standard organisational management diagrams for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Interactions diagram</li>
  <li>Sequence diagram</li>
  <li>Cause and effect diagram</li>
  <li>Risk evaluation diagram</li>
  <li>Critical path diagram (PERT/CPM)</li>
  <li>Flow diagram</li>
</ul>
<h4>The results?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Everybody knows and agrees on what is their role and what they need to provide us in order to get a client's instance properly set up.</li>
  <li>There are less back and forth on tickets. In the best we could reach more than a 100 comments on a ticket which was counter productive and even lead to mistakes</li>
  <li>Consequently to the previous ticket, less conflicts between departments and each assumes clearly its share of responsibilities.</li>
</ul>
