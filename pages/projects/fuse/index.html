    <p>
      Fuse's platform was already 8 years old when I joined and we can easily state the 2010's had been the teenage years of web and mobile development in terms of practices: lots of changes happening, lots of conflicts and lots of experimentations.
      Fuse got through all these changes, for the best but soemtimes also for the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore our team inherited the tedious task of fixing a lot of legacy design issues on an SAAS platform which had been built with very "lean" design process in mind.
      And don't get me wrong! I am not against getting lean when necessary but this is just a polite way of saying the UI inconsistencies and accessibility issues plagging the product speak for themselves 
      regarding this eventual process.
    </p>
    <p>
      On top of all this conundrum we can add this market differenciation our company was holding onto by offering extensive customisations for each client on a per site basis.
      Not only that but our system of customisable widgets (micro-frontends) were allowing our client to create their own functionalities with code from the backoffice and there was no way to differentiate our code from theirs.
      You probably see from a mile away all the complications this setup can bring upon.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Design inconsistencies due to a heavy history and lack of collaboration and several accessibility issues.</li>
      <li>No tracable history. There was no way to distinguish if a broken functionality was due to a bug or a change made by the client or what the client signed off for regarding old projects.</li>
      <li>The overreliance on custom widgets (as micro-frontends) and untested overrides (such as embedding the client's font) could impact performance and accessibility.</li>
      <li>Different practices from developer to developer and from designer to designer leading to many abuses of grey areas.</li>
      <li>A lack of common vocabulary between actors ending up with many misinterpreations and communications issues.</li>
      <li>Either no documentation or in the best case scenario some obsolete ones.</li>
      <li>Our team was owning a pretty niche knowledge but other departments were depending too much on us. Conflicting with our task of making the platform better.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Our team could have comfortably sat and play some lyre while the city was burning however we knew we could do better than that.

      Not an easy exercise to sum up 3 years with the constraints related to writing for the web therefore I will break this down in milestones.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Building a community of practices around the way we design and build our components: <a class="nav__link js-link--content" href="#page=projects/fuse/fuse-designsystem" target="_top" data-template="/pages/projects/fuse/fuse-designsystem">Read about how we created our design system</a></li>
      <li>Narrowing down our offer of custom widgets via a catalogue of our most accessibility-tested and performance savvy ones: <a class="nav__link js-link--content" href="#page=projects/fuse/fuse-clientdoc" target="_top" data-template="/pages/projects/fuse/fuse-clientdoc">Read about our client-facing documentation</a></li>
      <li>Documenting our process with transparency for the team, our solutions architects, our consultants and our partners: <a class="nav__link js-link--content" href="#page=projects/fuse/fuse-processdoc" target="_top" data-template="/pages/projects/fuse/fuse-processdoc">Read about our internal process documentation</a></li>

    <ul>
      <li>This approach has led to a significant decrease in bug tickets and amends requests</li>
      <li>We can trace our projects back easily thanks to better versioning practices with our designs and codes. Avoiding confusions with clients.</li>
      <li>Projects can be smoothly delegated from one team member to another without any frictions or conflicts since our practices are aligned</li>
      <li>Solution architects, consultants and partners don't need to rely on us anymore for sertain tasks since they can easily build prototypes from our design systems and customise documentations</li>
      <li>This saved us more time for focusing on more strategic goals and also resource related cost because we are able to delegate</li>
