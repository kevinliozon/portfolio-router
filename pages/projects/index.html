          All the cases below focus on a specific part of the design process for each project in order to provide an in-depth analysis and keeping it short.
          I am passing on the rest of the process because I likely deemed it less interesting but feel free to ask me if you are interested to hearing more!

      <h2>Management case studies</h2>
      <p>All the experiences I talk about below happened while I was being employed at Fuse Universal</p>
      <article>
          <h3>Higher admin panel redesign</h3>
          <h4>Themes</h4>
          <p>Consistency and developer experience</p>
          <h4>The project</h4>
          <p>Rebuilding the page governing the branding of each client website</p>
          <h4>My role</h4>
          <p>My experience and knowledge of how branding related styles are applied accross the product has helped me to lead this project</p>
          <h4>Collaborated with</h4>
          <p>Product designers and solution architects</p>
          <h4>The problem to solve</h4>
          <p>
              Admin panels have always been the forgotten child of webdesign. Many businesses assume that the clients are not supposed to use it
              therefore there is no point at improving its design and allocate dev ressources to rebuild it.
              Historically our platform one has always been subject to this kind of treatment hence it had become, to put it bluntly, a mess.
              But over all this, one area was standing out as even more messy than the rest: the page managing how the colours used accross the app
              (from the fonts to the container backgrounds).
          </p>
          <p>
              When I started at Fuse I remembered I sat down with my line manager just to understand the logic of which input was colouring which element.
              Of course some were pretty intuitively labelled such as "Footer background" but others were a bit less "Colour 8". For the little story the latter
              was a bit of a pain because it was affecting the hover background colour of a link in one widget but also the font colour used for specific elements
              of two other widgets. This was a huge problem actually because it meant one thing: To proper contrast this colour should always be dark.
              This illusion of multiple customisation option was both misleading and a potential risk of lowering consistency and accessibility accross the platform
          </p>
          <h4>How did we solve it?</h4>
          <p>
              Sometimes less is more. We wanted to achieve a better consistency accross the app and make sure the contrast ratio stays correct.
              Our plan of attack had been to reconsider the logic of which field should affect what and how to make our labels intuitive.
              First, instead of thinking on an element by element basis we used our knowledge of what clients were asking us to change in order to exclude
              the fields that were never relevant to there requests. Then we sorted out on a container basis. Therefore what is related to the footer sits
              under the footer category.
          </p>
          <h4>The results?</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>Solution architects don't need to rely on us anymore for updating or setting up the colour scheme of a client's instance</li>
              <li>This saved us more time for focusing on more strategic goals and also resource related cost because this step only involves solution architects from now on</li>

          <p>I have designed the templates for these documents and populated them alongside our technical writer</p>

          <h3>Redesign of our user facing documentation</h3>
          <h4>The project</h4>
          <p>Making our client handoff technical documentation for setting more intuitive and accessible</p>
          <h4>My role</h4>
          <p>Supervising the writing of this documentation and gathering feedbacks from internal actors and clients</p>
          <h4>Collaborated with</h4>
          <p>Technical writer, product designers, solution architects and customer success consultants</p>
          <h4>The problem to solve</h4>
          <p>
              Our design team was responsible to write the post delivery guide in order to empower our clients' with all the info
              required for using our custom widgets. Since basic knowledge in HTML was required we could consider this documentation
              as part of an overall developer experience delivery.
          </p>
          <p>
              Initially this documentation was tailored from clients to clients via a simple google doc file which was a pretty underwhelming
              and lacked visuals. Therefore a first initiative has been taken to improve this documentation with Sketch by making it visually more appealling
              with a layout that included more white space and some branding. Also we brought some visual cues to highlight the areas of the HTML
              the use had to edit for setting up each custom widget.
          </p>
          <p>
              However we had still some issues:
              <ul>
                  <li>Some areas were still hard to grasp especially for people with no experience in HTML</li>
                  <li>The presence of client's branding was not adding much value to the deliverable and this editing task could be avoided.</li>
                  <li>
                      Solutions architects and customer success consultants were supposed to be the ones onboarding the client with the platform
                      but they were depending on us to provide them with this critical piece of delivery because they did not have a Sketch licence.
                  </li>
              </ul>
          </p>
          <h4>How did we solve it?</h4>
          <p>
              I took the initiative to lead the revamp of this documentation. With the help of one of our product designers, our technical writer
              and the feedbacks from our pool of solutions architect as well as customer success consultants we pulled out a 2 weeks effort to get a single source
              of truth and brand agnostic documentation for onboarding our clients.
          </p>
          <h4>The results?</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>The siteguide has been rewritten with Figma which helped us at getting rid to our last software dependency to Sketch (therefore saving money).</li>
              <li>
                  Also the brand agnostic nature of the document coupled to the fact there is no more edition required to the document makes that we could delegate
                  this task to solution architects and customer success consultants. This made us saving 0.5 day of turnout when setting up the platform for the client.
              </li>
              <li>
                  We wanted to achieve a result that would be intuitive in order that even a first time HTML coder could be confident at putting his hands on some code.
                  So far we have received no request for editing the document from the clients.
