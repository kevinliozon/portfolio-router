<h2>Fuse Universal: A design system to rule them all</h2>

<p>All the experiences I talk about below happened while I was being employed at Fuse Universal</p>

<h4>Themes</h4>
<p>Design systems, accessibility, consistency, inclusive design</p>
<h4>The project</h4>
<p>Creating a design system that would serve as proof statement for our staffs and clients.</p>
<h4>My role</h4>
<p>Building its first iteration in Adobe XD, managing the creation of its second one in Figma and cementing it in our stylesheets</p>
<h4>Collaborated with</h4>
<p>Our product design team's mambers, solution architects and clients</p>
<h4>The problem to solve</h4>
<p>
  To be fully transparent, there has been no design system at Fuse for a very long time. If there had been one, it was definitely not documented
  and would follow a case by case approach where a squad could unilaterally decide their latest feature would not be consistent with the others.
</p>
<p>
  The fact we could offer custom functionalities for each client was making the hole of inconsistencies even deeper and we could easily lose track
  of why a specific design choice had been made in the past.
</p>
<p>
  Finally we wanted to offer the possibility to solutions architect to move away from their powerpoints used during workshops with clients and have a high fidelity
  prototype easy to layout instead.
</p>
<h4>How did we solve it?</h4>
<p>
  We solved id in three steps. First we needed to set limits in our offer and determine which were the most requested custom widgets
  that answered the following criteria for each:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is not redundant with one of our core functionality.</li>
  <li>It is stable with no record of performance, privacy and accessibility degradation. if no they should be adressed.</li>
  <li>It works on all browsers.</li>
  <li>The design should be brand agnostic for accessibility and productivity purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Second step was to actually create a standard template file that could be used for all projects with a colour palette easy to update in order to
  apply each client's branding. After spending a long time on Adobe XD we decided to move to Figma and it turned into an absolute game changer!
  This has definitely boosted our productivity and collaboration within our team but also with others. It also helped us with getting rid of our
  old design app ecosystem made of XD, Sketch, Miro, UXpin and Zeplin (and their subscriptions). We can now do everyhting we want with Figma.
</p>
<p>
  The third step has been to make this design system real by creating the CSS architecture that would reflect point by point what appears on Figma.
  In order to avoid conflicts with class names and make the stylesheets bullet proof I have opted for BEM since I already experienced the
  limits of SMACSS in my previous role at Surely.
</p>
<h4>The results?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>We can now deliver to clients without the fear of rolling out untested features</li>
  <li>Other teams such as our solutions architects and even our partners have the possibility to use our Figma template for pitching or laying out the product to clients.</li>
  <li>We have a fully safe stylesheet. No more bugs. The few we had (at the beginning) got solved for all clients because all the layout logic is shared across all our clients' instances</li>
</ul>
