      <div class="c-section__d">
        <p>
          Fuse's platform was already 8 years old when I joined and we can easily state the 2010's had been the teenage years of web and mobile development in terms of practices: lots of changes happening, lots of conflicts and lots of experimentations.
          Fuse got through all these changes, for the best but soemtimes also for the worst.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore our team inherited the tedious task of fixing a lot of legacy design issues on an SAAS platform which had been built with very "lean" design process in mind.
          And don't get me wrong! I am not against getting lean when necessary but this is just a polite way of saying the UI inconsistencies and accessibility issues plagging the product speak for themselves 
          regarding this eventual process.
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of all this conundrum we can add this market differenciation our company was holding onto by offering extensive customisations for each client on a per site basis.
          Not only that but our system of customisable widgets (micro-frontends) were allowing our client to create their own functionalities with code from the backoffice and there was no way to differentiate our code from theirs.
          You probably see from a mile away all the complications this setup can bring upon.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>There were many design inconsistencies and accessibility flaws due to the absence of community of practices and cross-department collaboration in the past.</li>
          <li>No tracable history. There was no way to distinguish if a broken functionality was due to a bug or a change made by the client or what the client signed off for regarding old projects.</li>
          <li>The overreliance on custom widgets (as micro-frontends) and untested overrides (such as embedding the client's font) could impact performance and accessibility.</li>
          <li>Different practices from developer to developer and from designer to designer leading to many abuses of grey areas.</li>
          <li>A lack of common vocabulary between actors ending up with many misinterpreations and communications issues.</li>
          <li>Either no documentation or in the best case scenario some obsolete ones.</li>
          <li>Our team was owning a pretty niche knowledge but other departments were depending too much on us. Conflicting with our task of making the platform better.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our team could have comfortably sat and play some lyre while the city was burning however we knew we could do better than that.

          <li>This approach has led to a significant decrease in bug tickets and amends requests</li>
          <li>We can trace our projects back easily thanks to better versioning practices with our designs and codes. Avoiding confusions with clients.</li>
          <li>Projects can be smoothly delegated from one team member to another without any frictions or conflicts since our practices are aligned</li>
          <li>Solution architects, consultants and partners don't need to rely on us anymore for sertain tasks since they can easily build prototypes from our design systems and customise documentations</li>
          <li>This saved us more time for focusing on more strategic goals and also resource related cost because we are able to delegate</li>
