          Whether we are a professional or a casual user we tend to look for easy ways to get any useful info in a quick and easy way.
          Of course this often turns out to get difficult when the info is very specific or requires to be refined and interpreted from raw data.
        </p>

        <p>
          Indeed some data can be very abstract and complex to interpret. This is where dashboard can do miracles by showing it in a user-friendly way in order
          to save the reader time and headaches.

        <p>
          I had the opportunity to work on 3 dashboard designs in the past. Each corresponds to a different use case / problematic:
        </p>

        <ul class="c-list">
          <li class="c-list__i">
            For an IoT mobile app. The client was Lloyds bank and the challenge lied in the variety of data we were receiving from
            each connected object such as fire, leak and even security risk data among others within a smaill viewport.
            We had to find a way to simplify these metrics so the user can understand each level of risk at a glance.
          </li>
          <li class="c-list__i">
            For an insurtech app. The client was Endeavour (from Lloyds of London) and needed its employees to see an overview of the indications
            and policies they were about to sell. The emphasizes was on surfacing the different potential clients, their geographic and industrial data.
          </li>
          <li class="c-list__i">
            For an eLearning app. We had a dashboard page aimed at manager users that helped them tracking engagement from their team via Universal Analytics and Mixpanel.
            Aside from that, dashboards were also present in specific areas such as the learning page where they could look at their reportees' progress.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

    <section id="solution" class="c-section">
      <header class="c-section__h"><h3 class="c-section__h__title">Solution: Know your audience</h3></header>
      
      <div class="c-section__d">
        <p>
          Before considering dashboards as solution for your users' needs you should answer the following questions
        </p>

        <ul class="c-list">
          <li class="c-list__i">
            What is the case for implementing such feature? Is it helping our end users to perform their task efficiently?
            How did you come to the conclusion this was the only solution to achieve this purpose?
          </li>
          <li class="c-list__i">
            Where do we need dashboards? Having having them sitting in a landing page has become kind of a trend but sometimes
            they could be of a better use in other pages.
          </li>
          <li class="c-list__i">
            Can we vulgarise the data we receive in such a way it becomes more understandable to the end-user?
          </li>
          <li class="c-list__i">
            How can we display the data? Bar chart, pie chart or map among others? Are we showing numerical values or abstract trends?
            There is no real standard and the graphical representations used should be relevant.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I highly encourage to answer these tests before going ahead. Many clients / employers tend to want this
          type of feature for the look and feel rather than its real benefit for the user. There is nothing wrong with this
          type of intention since it is mostly driven by a desire of being cutting-edge and competitive on the market.

        <p>
          For each one of the projects we had a different approach:
        </p>

        <ul class="c-list">
          <li class="c-list__i">
            Lloyds Connect and Protect: We had to get around the lack of space on a mobile screen and make sure we were displaying the info that
            was absolutely relevant. Thankfully we had conducted enough testing during the ideation session and got a lot of feedback for refining
            the designs during UAT. An approach of progressive disclosure would be favoured so the user can access more details by tapping the relevant area.
          </li>
          <li class="c-list__i">
            Endeavour's Broker Portal: For this one we had more space to play with however implementing the map and scaling the values of the
            barcharts have been the real challenge. In the first case we had to ensure the map would zoom in such way all the positions
            would be visible in the view. Regarding the barcharts the values could vary depending on the popularity of a product (more potential clients)
            so we had to specify the two axis would vary independently depending on their respective min and max values for each bar to be visible.
          </li>
          <li class="c-list__i">
            Fuse's platform: We decided to turn the learning page from a loose collection of courses to a complete hub that would also feature our team's
            progress if we are a manager user. The emphasis was put on highlighting which team members are behind in terms of progress because our user
            interviews taught us this type of user cared mostly about tracking who is lagging and notifying them to finish their mandatory assignments (e.g. courses for regulations).
