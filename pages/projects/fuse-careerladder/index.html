          A career ladder can complements OKRs in the sense it focuses on the actual skillset of every team member.
          Each profile is unique but it is still good practice to make sure everyone is aligned about the skills that are needed by the organisation.

        </p>
        <p>
          The quality of OKRs depend upon who wrote them and the knowledge that person had of everyone's role and how they have been communicated.
          In all cases they tend to show their limits when they focus at an individual level due to their abstract nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          They also do not inform enough around the skills needed to conduct certain tasks and objectives. We can know what we have to do but how can we do it?

          Another potential beneficiary of career ladders is the business itself. Not everyone knows what it takes to be a designer and being transparent
          with other departments about what we expect from the team can help them understanding where we can help.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I became design manager, the existing career ladder was incomplete and featured some legacy roles such as specialist UI designer and Experience developer (sort of UX engineer).
          We needed to both update it and write it again in a way that distinguished roles with too many discrepencies between each others.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also there was a concern from leadership regarding the skills and experience of some member of the team. So it was important we testify of
          the legitimity of everyone in their role by benchmarking their competencies against such document.

          Producing a new career ladder requires a full alignment from the team otherwise we risk it to be perceived as arbitrary.
          Therefore I have made sure to work on it alongside the lead product designer and to regularly keep the team informed about its content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also I made sure to clarify this is not a "scoresheet". The purpose of this document is to help the team understanding what skills are valued
          by the organisation and what to do in order to match the expectations. Not matching a specific skill does not prevent someone to be recognised
          just like the opposite does not entitle someone to be promoted.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case two set of skills are distinguished. The organisational skills defined by HR (communication, culture fit...) and the role
          specific ones defined by myself (and the team indirectly).

          Writing this document and getting it validated by both the team, HR and leadership helped me moving to the next step: benchmarking my team.
          To do so I have organised a couple of one-to-ones for each member during which I asked them to evaluate themselves before looking at it together.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason I did this was to ensure they interpreted each skill properly (the organisational were quite abstract) and to provide my own perception.
          Most of the time they tended to underestimate themselves so that was the opportunity to give them some confidence boost. 
          For the very few times they overrated their skills I could tell then give them advice about how to reach that level and what they lacked.
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all it has been a great opportunity to clarify what we should expect from the team, that they were actually delivering (clearing the few doubts)
          but also helped to bond with them and understand how they perceived themselves and their aspirations.
