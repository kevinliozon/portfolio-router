      <div class="c-section__d">
        <p>
          For a long time, accessibility has not been a priority for Fuse. Over the course of 10 years, new features have been rolled out with more focus
          on making them work under "normal circumstances". Therefore the following outcomes were regular occurences:
        </p>

        <ul class="c-list">
          <li class="c-list__i">Browsers outside Google Chrome were ignored, excluding legacy system users and the elderly</li>
          <li class="c-list__i">Performance could be subpar with no indication of progress. No loader when we navigate with poor Internet</li>
          <li class="c-list__i">Colour contrasts and legibility of texts were sometimes insufficient</li>
          <li class="c-list__i">Contents and navigation were not optimised for assistive technologies</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          At a QA level, the fidelity to the signed off designs was often overlooked. Rather focusing on user stories and user flows.
          Worse, there was not testing with assistive technologies conducted.
        </p>

      <div class="c-section__d">
        <p>
          Having many international clients, Fuse realised some companies and countries had higher expectations in terms of accessibility compared to others.
          This has been the case with some contracts lost because we were not fully complying with the Canadian Standard on Web Accessibility (2011).
        </p>
        <p>
          The latter stipulates any government websites and web applications should conform to WCAG 2.0 Level AA.
          Of course outside of the government it does not apply, however some canadian organisations take this at heart and made it a social responsibility commitment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is where Fuse realised the potential of adopting such policy to differentiate itself from the competition and hold to their primary objective
          of making education available to everyone.

        <p>
          As mentioned above, several aspects of accessibility were ignored and it was our role as designers to ensure they would be taken into account from now on.
          This is where a company wide commitment made our task easier because we had a clear mandate to push for new practices. Therefore we could now:
        </p>

        <ul class="c-list">
          <li class="c-list__i">Ask for any UI component to perform on any browser</li>
          <li class="c-list__i">Specify the loading behaviour: indication on progress, skeletons, progressive loading to allow progressive disclosure</li>
          <li class="c-list__i">Challenge branding decisions (mostly colours) that impacted negatively on legibility and contrasts. Especially when implementing the platform for clients</li>
          <li class="c-list__i">Require QA to conduct testing with assistive technologies</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We have also approached several client-facing actors such as consultants, pre-sales and business analysts in order to communicate these decisions to our clients.
          It has been the opportunity to push our new <a class="js-link c-link" href="#page=projects/fuse-system" target="_top" data-template="/pages/projects/fuse-system" data-name="Design system" aria-label="Fuse design system for non-designers page">standardised design</a>
          with our older clients using legacy designs.
        </p>
      </div>

      <figure class="c-fig u-center">
        <button class="c-btn js-img">
          <img class="c-fig__img c-btn__img" src="/assets/img/placeholder.jpg" alt="Placeholder">
          <figcaption class="c-fig__c">Placeholder 3</figcaption>

    </section>

    <section id="outcomes" class="c-section">
      <header class="c-section__h"><h3 class="c-section__h__title">Outcomes: A huge step forward</h3></header>
      
      <div class="c-section__d">
        <p>
          Of course this has not been an automatic switch and we had to convince our audience of the benefits it would bring.
          However we can clearly say that the awareness of everyone in the organisation has grown over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact we had also more arguments to convince our clients to switch to our new design system helped solving several accessibility issues
          that could have backfired at some point but made all these projects easier to maintain due to their standardised nature (using shared stylesheets).
          Therefore we could say it even saved us money down the line due to the reduction in bug tickets.
