      <div class="c-section__d">
        <p>
          For a long time, accessibility was unfortunately not a priority for Fuse. Over the course of 10 years, new features have been rolled out with more focus
          on making them work without really considering assistive technologies or edge case scenarios. Therefore the following outcomes were regular occurences:
        </p>

        <ul class="c-list">
          <li class="c-list__i">Browsers outside Google Chrome were ignored, excluding legacy system users and the elderly.</li>
          <li class="c-list__i">Performance could be subpar the absence of loaders and error messages in some areas could be confusing.</li>
          <li class="c-list__i">Colour contrasts and legibility of texts were sometimes insufficient.</li>
          <li class="c-list__i">Contents and navigation were not optimised for some assistive technologies such as screen readers (alt tags and aria labels).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          At a QA level, the fidelity to the signed off designs was often overlooked. Rather focusing on user stories and user flows.
          Worse, there was not testing with assistive technologies conducted.

        <p>
          Having many international clients, Fuse realised some companies and countries had higher expectations in terms of accessibility compared to others.
          This has been the case with some contracts lost because we were not fully complying with the Canadian Standard on Web Accessibility (2011).
        </p>
        <p>
          The latter stipulates any government websites and web applications should conform to WCAG 2.0 Level AA.
          Of course outside of the government it does not apply, however some canadian organisations take this at heart and made it a social responsibility commitment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is where Fuse realised the potential of embracing such policies to differentiate itself from the competition and hold to their primary objective
          of making education available to everyone.

          As mentioned above, several aspects of accessibility were ignored and it was our role as designers to ensure they would be taken into account from now on.
          This is where a company wide commitment made our task easier because we had a clear mandate to push for new practices. Therefore we could now:
        </p>

        <ul class="c-list">
          <li class="c-list__i">Ask for any UI component to perform on any browser</li>
          <li class="c-list__i">Specify the loading behaviour: message, skeletons, lazy loading among others</li>
          <li class="c-list__i">Specify the edge case scenarios and behaviour for each error</li>
          <li class="c-list__i">Challenge branding decisions (mostly colours) that impacted negatively on legibility and contrasts. Especially when implementing the platform for clients</li>
          <li class="c-list__i">Require QA to conduct testing with assistive technologies</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We have also approached several client-facing actors such as consultants, pre-sales and business analysts in order to communicate these decisions to our clients.
          It has been the opportunity to push our new <a class="js-link c-link" href="#page=projects/fuse-system" target="_top" data-template="/pages/projects/fuse-system" data-name="Fuse design system" aria-label="Project page: Building a design system for non-designers">standardised design</a>
          with our older clients using legacy designs.
        </p>

      <header class="c-section__h"><h3 class="c-section__h__title">Outcomes: A huge step forward</h3></header>
      
      <div class="c-section__d">
        <p>
          Of course this has not been an automatic switch and we had to convince our audience of the benefits it would bring.
          However we can clearly say that the awareness of everyone in the organisation has grown over time. On top of that we could introduce
          everyone to some tools helping to perform basic accessibility checks when implementing new projects:
        </p>

        <ul class="c-list">
          <li class="c-list__i">Contrast checker such as Stark (Figma plugin) or online ones</li>
          <li class="c-list__i">
            Dev tools to check the pages loading speed. 
            Consultants could then make sure clients were not filling up pages with performance damaging contents
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The fact we had also more arguments to convince our clients to switch to our new design system helped solving several accessibility issues
          that could have backfired at some point. It has also made all these projects easier to maintain due to their standardised nature (using shared stylesheets).
          Therefore we could say it even saved us money down the line due to the reduction in bug tickets.
