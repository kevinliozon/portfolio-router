        <p>
          Fuse is a SAAS platform used by more than <b>130 businesses</b> and its key differentiator on the market is that it offers more options for customisation compared to its competitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          These customisations could range from the integration of a client's branding to the possibility of changing the layout of a page. However the bespoke nature of some projects
          has not only led us to drift away from a proper design process but cornered us into creating new pieces of functionalities. Of which their design was most of the time insufficiently tested. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Another issue was the redundant nature of designing an instance for a client. It was not the most challenging experience on a technical point of view and designers were usually not
          fighting for such projects. Prefering to work on features instead because of the bigger investment in user research.

        <p>
          We had recently adopted Figma as our new design software after years of using Adobe XD and Sketch in tandem.
          The highly collaborative nature of Figma made it an ideal subject of experimentation:
          what if we could extend this collaboration with other departments?
        </p>

        <p>
          We quickly realised that we could allow anyone in the organisation to copy one of our templates and allow them to modify restricted areas of a design such as the colours or the logos.
          It could potentially allow people in pre-sales or consultants to show designs as previews for a client to understand how their branding could reflect in Fuse's platform.

          We decided to create a lean design system specifically for Services' team operations.
          It would not only be a good way to introduce ourselves to Figma's features but also to have a tool dedicated to implementation projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          It made the most of Figma's components and dynamic colour palettes and was designed in such a way Consultants could easily create high fidelity
          templates in front of prospects/clients (applying their branding in real time).
        </p>
        <p>
          Any update from the product design team could be rolled without having to ask consultants to download a new version. The Figma link would do the magic.

          It was not only an opportunity for the team to upskill with a new tool but also to create a design system that could be delegated to non-designers.
          Of course it came with the caveat of preventing them from editing unauthorised areas and required us to still conduct accessibility QAs for each project.
          However we were saving a lot of time compared to doing it ourselves which helped us to free up some capacity for our team.
        </p>
        <p>
          More importantly it allowed us to review and <a class="js-link c-link" href="#page=projects/fuse-a11y" target="_top" data-template="/pages/projects/fuse-a11y" data-name="Fuse accessibility" aria-label="Project page: Conducting an accessibility audit">reconsider the accessibility risk associated to several UI components</a>
          thus getting the platform closer to the AA standard of WCAG. A catalogue would reference each component individually with its rendering for each viewport's breakpoints.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally consultants could quickly produce vetted designs which would soon after become live on prod thanks to pre-defined stylesheets with very little technical knowledge required.
          Basically from an average implementation time (design + platform set up) of <b>4.9 days</b> we were down to <b>0.8 days</b> (yes it is a 0) thanks to this new comprehensive design system.
          Consequently it resulted in less complaints from clients about discrepancies between signed-off designs and the final implementation with <b>48%</b> fewer support tickets.
