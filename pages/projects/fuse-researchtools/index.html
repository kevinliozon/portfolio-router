          During a standard discovery phase we tend to gather a lot of information, either from analytics or user interview.

          A list of numbers, several transcripts of user interviews that do not look enticing to read and a a list of reasons as to why "this feature" will
          solve users problems problem. This is likely the kind of discovery document many of us have had to get through in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discovery documents should not only be a loose collection of data with assumptions but should also filter them and explain our reasoning.
          At Fuse our discovery documents tended to be just like this. UX designers were not involved during the discovery phase and Product managers were
          responsible of putting this document together with all the raw data and transcripts from interviews.

        <p>
          As stated we had two issues, the lack of data intepretation and ownership from UX during the discovery phase.
          And the blame was not on the product managers because most of the responsibility of this phase was on their shoulders and they
          were quite overwhelmed most of the time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since we were also <a class="js-link c-link" href="#page=projects/fuse-process" target="_top" data-template="/pages/projects/fuse-process" data-name="Fuse process" aria-label="Fuse process project page">shaking up our design process</a>
          We had a perfect opportunity to reconsider this critical phase of the design process and redefine the balance of ownership between
          the product manager and the product designer.

      <div class="c-section__d">
        <p>
          Therefore we agreed user interviews and their interpretation should be led by designers. Of course the product manager would still be involved
          but we would take the responsibilities for this part.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from this I decided to introduce a set of practices and tools in order to help us interpreting the data we were receiving,
          especially coming from user interviews. These tools were made with Figma and Miro and could easily be reused across projects via
          a simple copy-paste.
        </p>
        <p>
          The angular stone of the research would sit in the empathy map that would lead to creating real life personas of our users.
          These personas would not only provide accurate info about our user needs (since they are based on real people) but could
          potentially be stored and reused for future similar projects.

      <div class="c-section__d">
        <p>
          Down the line we have also solved another problem that I did not mention: The fact designers were not feeling involved and felt they
          had to design features based upon the product manager interpretations.
        </p>
        <p>
          From now on designers can have a critical impact on any project from the beginning and could also use a set of scalable and
          easy to use tools in Figma that anyone could contribute to.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was even more rewarding to see product managers realising we could actually draw out conclusions from research we could have never done
          without this type of approach and asking we keep doing so in the future.
