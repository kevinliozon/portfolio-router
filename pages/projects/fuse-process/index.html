        <p class="c-jumbo__desc">
          The product management team was going through a restructuring and had to subsequently redefine their process and the design one was of course a critical building block of this big picture.

      <div class="c-section__d">
        <p>
          The resignation of our previous head of product design came at the most inopportune moment. Product managers needed decisions to be taken in terms of how and when design tasks should be conducted within the new process.
          Indeed the design process was not working. I would break down the main flaws as follow:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lack of accountabilities and absence of stage gates. Designers were often blamed down the line for design decisions.</li>
          <li>Designers were not involved enough during the discovery and research phases. There was also a scarcity of user research evidence to solidify the discovery document.</li>
          <li>Most of the interviews were led by the product manager whose focus was more oriented towards delivering a feature rather than understanding the user’s problem.</li>
          <li>Absence of lo-fi wireframes. Having those validated before iterating hi-fi prototypes prevents amending the latter which can be chronophage.</li>
          <li>User flows were defined after the ideation session, during the requirements and even prototyping phase. It is good practice to have them done early to understand our users’ journey and visualise the error and success cases. They should be a point of reference for prototypes. Amended post-prototyping, they lose their purpose.</li>
        </ul>

          The main challenges were the unexpected resignation of the head of product design (which triggered a restructuring of the product department) and a sense of urgency due to a roadmap full of commitments to clients.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a design manager, I covered our Product Design’s operations during this period of uncertainty.
          Furthermore, my role was to be a UX advocate for the whole organisation.
          Therefore one of my subsequent tasks was to work alongside product managers to propose a new design process.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was indeed a balancing exercise between ensuring retention in the team, making sure all deliverables for the roadmap were shipped on time and working on our process with the product management team.

      <div class="c-section__d">
        <p>
          The realisation that we needed a new design process was not recent. The debate had been up in the air for a long time with not much progress. The latest events were thankfully an opportunity to start anew since the leadership was open to letting me propose new options too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore I tried my best to capture other teams' understanding of how UX can contribute. I was also animating our team stand-ups and one-to-ones in parallel so everyone in Product Design could voice their concerns and propose solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this info at hand, I could draft my first design process flow diagrams and get them reviewed by product managers to see how they could fit in the whole canvas of the product development process. Of course, it took several rounds of amends and debate until we finally got to an overall consensus.
        </p>
        <p>
          My approach was to isolate each phase in the product development process (which required a product designer) before committing to a type of deliverable for each:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Discovery would see the designers delivering their findings from the data they had access to and the user interviews (e.g. empathy maps and personas).</li>
          <li>Ideation would see iterating several user flows and lo-fi wireframes that would serve as materials for the requirements phase.</li>
          <li>Requirements would be the opportunity for the product designer, the UX writer and the product manager to sit together and refine the microcopy.</li>
          <li>Prototyping would be the apex of all the work accomplished before through the first hi-fi representation of the feature.</li>
        </ul>

          Despite the initial consensus, the restructuring of the product department led to further amends to that process but it was all for the best. The lesson I have learnt here is that no process is set in stone.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will never be perfect because processes should constantly adapt to the surrounding context and the overall organisation. Therefore they need to be challenged and reviewed regularly every time a strategic decision or organisational event occurs.
