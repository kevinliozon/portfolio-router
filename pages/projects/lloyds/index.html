<h2>Lloyds Connect and Protect: How coding improved my approach to design</h2>

<p>All the experiences I talk about below happened while I was being employed at Surely Group</p>

<h4>Themes</h4>
<p>Design systems, accessibility, consistency, scalability</p>
<h4>The project</h4>
<p>Building an innovative insuretech IoT mobile application for a leading banking Group.</p>
<h4>Targeted users</h4>
<p>Over 8000 users during the last UAT phase</p>
<h4>My role</h4>
<p>Contributing to ideation sessions, creating wireframes and contributing to building the front-end with Ionic</p>
<h4>Collaborated with</h4>
<p>Lloyds Banking Group's R&D team and our italian partners Domotz providing the domotic API</p>
<h4>The problem to solve</h4>
<p>
  The story of Lloyds Connect and Protect is the story of several R&D applications trying to break the status quo in order to compete in pretty recent sectors such as the IoT and the insurtech.
  As every novel product trying to make their own space within a market which is still having its rules being defined (we are in 2016), the scope and size of the project were still uncertain at the beginning.
  If you factor in the fact Lloyds C&P was trying to pierce in two such industries you can probably get an idea of the size of this challenge.
</p>
<p>
  Even though preventive market researches got conducted by Lloyds' R&D team, leading to several definitions of the users' needs, there was still no clear cut about
  what was the best way to answer these needs. It has been a sort of endless discory process from ideation to implementation for everyvody (client included), which was both
  exciting and terribly challenging.
</p>
<p>
  The main challenge was keeping the design consistent through the different rebrandings. Indeed the application was supposed to be branded after Lloyds Bank itself before switching to Halifax.
  Indeed this change was welcome since Halifax have a more creative brands brand (anybody remembers their Scooby-Doo ads?) and the stakeholders became less risk averse.
  Another notable challenge was two other design teams had been involved at an earlier stage and the initial prototypes were cluttered with inconsistencies in terms of font-sizes and gutters.
</p>
<h4>How did we solve it?</h4>
<p>
  Thankfully our interactions with the client and the partner were pretty fluid. Domotz were providing us with the API in order to communicate with the home connected devices and
  we were focusing on the front-end and the backend of the mobile app. Before starting any implementation I got involved very early in several workshops with the client and the partner.
  On the downside they were long, really long! They could last the full day sometimes. However we were not losing our time at all since we were navigating in unknown waters. Therefore we needed
  both to go through every user stories and make sure the functionalities we were planning to add would be usable and relevant to the end-user.
</p>
<p>
  I was working closely alongside another front-end devloper and a solution architect.
  My focus was mostly on the CSS part and very early I made sure to make the SASS stylesheets as scalable as possible. To achieve this objective I followed these guidelines:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Writing DRY code by exploiting the full potential of SASS with reusable @mixins, @include and @extend methods</li>
  <li>Keeping a single responsibility logic for each stylesheet and separating them in smaller partial files to improve maintainability</li>
  <li>Using variables for colours, containers sizes, font properties and gutters/margins in order to insure consistency from the design</li>
</ul>
<p>
  That focus on code may sound pretty odd for a designer but this is my understanding of coding that made me so sensible to the importance of consistency and efficiency in a design.
  While coding, you need to keep scalability and maintainability in mind from the beginning. This approach insures any amend or future iterations will be smooth and quick to implement.
  The same applies to design, we need to make sure every change of colour or size applies retro actively to each component. This opens also a lot of possibility in terms of A/B testing.
</p>
<p>
  Despite the several changes and amend requests that followed the User Acceptance Testing stages we always managed to easily update the layouts and how data from the API would render.
  I consider this project as one of the most important of my career and I had the chance to experience it early on. I have made bad design and dev choices of course but I always found a way
  to solution them and learn from these.
</p>
<h4>The results?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Most of the stylesheet architecture I have created was reused in our next Ionic project. Saving us a lot of time.</li>
  <li>The project reached its second phase of UAT by the time I left Surely. The first one being successfuly rolled with several hundreds Lloyds' employees having a home cover with Lloyds. The second phase targeted more than 8000 existing Lloyds' customers and some from other providers.</li>
</ul>
