          Flow diagrams are important to the design process because they can reference the different actions expected from the users
          as well as the different edge case scenarios. They can also complement user stories and help engineers interpreting better what is expected.
        </p>
  
        <p class="c-jumbo__desc">
          However this is not always enough to visualise the whole user's journey hence the need to support it with some visual representation.

      <div class="c-section__d">
        <p>
          At Fuse, the responsibility to create user flows was not clearly attributed to anyone when a new project would kick off.
          Sometimes it may be owned by the product owner who would write them down past the requirements phase, which was too late.
          Sometimes they were defined by the product manager during the discovery phase, which is too early in this case...
        </p>
        <p>
          Flow diagrams should be the basis of your solution and that solution should stem from the ideation phase.
          The decisions taken at that stage should be articulated around the user's needs hence the UX practitioner is the
          best placed to lead that part and make sure his diagrams capture all the possible events in the user's journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rest to make sure this journey is properly conveyed to the rest of the product team because the main weakness of this type of diagram
          is its tendency to not provide enough context. This may of course lead to misinterpreting the complexity of some of the end-user's expected actions.

          In parallel we were <a class="js-link c-link" href="#page=projects/fuse-process" target="_top" data-template="/pages/projects/fuse-process" data-name="Fuse process" aria-label="Fuse process project page">reviewing our design process</a>
          and the question of "when should we start designing?" arose naturally.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past we tended to start prototyping too early, even before the requirements were written down in order to "have a head start".
          Most of time this led to many time-consuming design amends on hi-fi prototypes instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is where lo-fi prototypes appeared as a perfect compromise because they could serve as visual representations for the flow diagrams
          and prevent us from spending too much time on designing hi-fi too early.

          Together with product managers we agreed designers would lead the definition of user flow diagrams and product managers would support them on ensuring
          they would cover absolutely all the use and edge cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          The flow diagrams would become the seed from which would stem different potential solutions aiming at solving the end-user's problem.
          Those solutions would take the form of lo-fi designs that we would get tested against each others by samples of end-users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if none of the solution was fit to solve the overhaul problem we could review the strengths of each proposal and merge them into
          new ones. We would get these new iterations tested until we nailed it.

        <p>
          This A/B testing approach with lo-fi designs was not easy to sell internally at the beginning. However we managed to make the case that:
          <ul class="c-list">
            <li class="c-list__i">Our clients liked being involved regardless how basic a design may look like.</li>
            <li class="c-list__i">Usability tests with lo-fi designs provided us with valuable feedback about more abstract aspects of the journey such as the navigation and its purpose.</li>
            <li class="c-list__i">On the other hand, those condicted with hi-fi designs were mostly related to the visual details and the contents' info.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Flow diagrams would be the center piece around which the design process would articulate and the lo-fi designs
          would ensure everyone in the product team understood the solution we were aiming to implement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore these deliverables would become a sort of contract and be key elements to be approved and signed off by all parties at the end of the ideation phase.
          Later on they would help when writing down the requirements and the user stories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally it benefited us a lot in terms of productivity and design options.
          Testing, iterating through and amending lo-fi designs is easier than doing so with hi-fi ones.
          It also allows us to detect incoherences and and edge case scenarios early in the design process which prevents us from stumbling upon them too late.
