      Having a multi-disciplinary team working on a product can come with some trade-offs.
      It might be a design process issue, a lack of decision making at certain checkpoints or the fact people's skillset is not being used adequatly.

      There is no overthinking in trying to get things done properly from start. It will turn out to be quite a relief on the long run indeed.
      One of the most exciting project I worked on was an insuretech IoT mobile application for Lloyds Banking Group and Halifax.
      Innovative projects especially can evolve in unexpected ways and we often have to deal with several trade offs.
    </p>
    <p>Here I will prove you how properly defining the user's need from the beginning paired with a consistent and device coherent design system can reduce these negative impacts.</p>

    <h3>You have to go through a rebrand?</h3>
    <p>
      Wether it is an internal or a client rebrand, it always come with a set of constraints that would require compromise. It comes also with several opportunities
      to make up for past design mistakes and start anew with better standards of accessibility and design consistency at reach. However stakeholders will need to be convinced
      and this is what we will be looking at with those very specific cases.

      At Fuse, I got to work through some clients rebrands. Of course I am not going to list all of them but will focus instade on the most high stakes ones.

    <h3>Seeking for advices and support with at-risk clients?</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes a project does not go as expected: internal or client-related cross wiring, structural changes in the middle of the project scope, failed product education or implementation...
      There are multiple reasons why we end up sitting at a table with a confused or angry stakeholder, who either got sold something that did not exist or misunderstood what he was signing for.
    </p>
    <p>
      This kind of exposure taught me a lot about users' expectations. Far from the very codified and comfortable user testing interviews, we get to really connect with the client when the stakes are high.
      This is where sympathy transcends the concepts of empathy (sorry for the overused buzzword). The ability to not only understand what the user feel but also share the struggle.

    <p class="c-block__info">
      Before I start my journey as a designer I used to be on-site support for the medical staffs of the university hospital of Montpellier.
      Most of our interventions were related to users being confused by questionnable design choices that made the user journey complicated rather than bugs.
      Consequently I came to realise the impact of design on the tools used by an organisation.

    <p class="c-block__info">
      Starting a project is like diving. You do not do that anywhere, anytime and anyhow.
      You need to know your objective, prepare your journey and get ready to reconsider it at any time once you are under water.
      You need to ensure people around you are not lost or overwhelemed.
      It is not just about looking at nice things but also making sure everyone is at the same page and supporting each other.

  <h2>How I approach approach design problems</h2>

  <p>
    Sometimes the complexity of a project is not defined by its size but the problems it aims to solve.
    When commitments and deadlines get in the way it may be a recipe for disaster.
    I make sure my approach to design is adapted to every scenario and I am prepared to any eventuality.

      Working with a client's R&D team sounds like a very specific situation, but being exposed to such one early in my career taught me a lot.

    <h3>Education</h3>

    <p>
      I have undergraduated in webdesign at the institute of technology of Montbéliard and postgraduated in management at the institute of business administration of Poitiers.
      Both diplomas are respectively recognised as bachelor and masters degree by the french ministry of education and both schools are public funded (entry exam for the latter).
      I have started studying in webdesign all the way back in 2012.

      In order to keeping up to date I follow the studies that are released by the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/" target="_blank">Nielsen & Norman Group</a>
      (one of the most renowned authority in user research). I am also certified in webdesign and interaction Design by them and have also attended their courses

    <h3>How I got into UX</h3>

    <p>
      The first time I came to realise the impact of design on the tools used by an organisation was when I got hired to support medical staffs during
      the deployment of a new patient management system across the whole university hospital of Montpellier in France back in summer 2012.
      We were all assigned on site (making it easier for staffs to reach out to us) and most of the issues we had to help with were related to confusing design choices
      that made the user journey complicated rather than bugs.

    <h3>Activities</h3>

    <p>
      Being level 3 CMAS and level 1 PADI, scuba-diving is probably the activity that taught me the more. When diving, staying focused,
      keeping calm and looking constanstly after the people diving alongside you is critical. I have learnt that panicking only leads to bad decisions
      and that keeping a team involved is necessary in order to react efficiently in any situation. I also practice kendo but I still need to learn a lot here!
