<h2>Service minded design manager</h2>
<p>
  Looking at helping you with scaling your product from its definition to its release and user adoption.
  My commercial experiences covered several industries, various types and sizes of projects.
  They also span across areas such as risk and change management.
</p>
<h3>Here are some areas I can give you a hand with</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Building efficient design systems that will save you time and effort down the line</li>
  <li>Optimising processes for design and implementation</li>
  <li>Ensuring product delivery that complies with the blueprint</li>
  <li>Change management within product teams and building communities of practices based upon concensus</li>

  <h2>Looking for some help or input?</h2>
  <p>
      Let's cut short with the usual portfolio memorabilia/throwback. You are here because you need a problem to get solved or an input.
      Hopefully the list below will describe a situation similar to yours and give you an idea of how I can help you at finding solutions.
      Each case study is divided in more specific ones that answer very defined issues in case you are coming across a similar one.

    <h3>Need to put in place a design process or scale up your product team?</h3>
    <p>
      There is no shame about this. Many businesses are in the same court. 
      Let's be honnest though, this can be a tough situation because it will not only require to compromise with a lot of technical debts and restrictions
      but we also naturally tend to prefer working on new shiny things rather than refurbishing old rusty ones.
      However this kind of challenge is probably one of those that helped me to learn the most and realise the importance of scalability and having clear processess in place.
    </p>
    <p>Let me show you how we turned the tide at Fuse Universal by moving away from our old ways and solved several design related fairly common problems</p>

    <h3>Want to design and build a product with scalability in mind?</h3>
    <p>
      There is no overthinking in trying to get things done properly from start. It will turn out to be quite a relief on the long run indeed.
      One of the most exciting project I worked on was an insuretech IoT mobile application for Lloyds Banking Group and Halifax.
      Innovative projects especially can evolve in unexpected ways and we often have to deal with several trade offs.
    </p>
    <p>Here I will prove you how properly defining the user's need from the beginning paired with a consistent and device coherent design system can reduce these negative impacts.</p>

    <p>This project for BAE system below is slightly different but will show you how a solid design system can give you a head start even though the brand guidelines have not been provided by the client.</p>

    <h3>You have to go through a rebrand?</h3>
    <p>
      Wether it is an internal or a client rebrand, it always come with a set of constraints that would require compromise. It comes also with several opportunities
      to make up for past design mistakes and start anew with better standards of accessibility and design consistency at reach. However stakeholders will need to be convinced
      and this is what we will be looking at with those very specific cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Fuse, I got to work through some clients rebrands. Of course I am not going to list all of them but will focus instade on the most high stakes ones.
      Either because the user base was huge or because the client was a flagship one.
    </p>

    <p>Avon is one of our most important client</p>

    <p>Dropbox wanted a different branding than their usual one for their learning platform. This is how we helped them.</p>

    <h3>Seeking for advices and support with at-risk clients?</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes a project does not go as expected: internal or client-related cross wiring, structural changes in the middle of the project scope, failed product education or implementation...
      There are multiple reasons why we end up sitting at a table with a confused or angry stakeholder, who either got sold something that did not exist or misunderstood what he was signing for.
    </p>
    <p>
      This kind of exposure taught me a lot about users' expectations. Far from the very codified and comfortable user testing interviews, we get to really connect with the client when the stakes are high.
      This is where sympathy transcends the concepts of empathy (sorry for the overused buzzword). The ability to not only understand what the user feel but also share the struggle.

      I am product designer but I like coding. Yes I do. My understanding of front-end technologies makes I do not only focus on the visual aspect of accessibility
      but also its technical aspect (implementation, equipments and browser compatibility). Also I am a strong advocate for performance optimisation in order
      to improve the user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
      My academic training in design and management definitely kickstarted my career but I keep on harnessing my skills. Therefore I also certified with the UX research leader
      <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/" target="_blank">Nielsen & Norman Group</a> and in accessibility

    <h2>Want to make a product or feature real?</h2>
    <p>
        My experience in both ideating and building applications but also in extending functionalities from existing ones is my best tool.
        The part I love about my job is seeing an idea emerge and materialise physically (or rather digitally) while being involved in each step of the process.

    <h2>Need to make your creative team's life easier?</h2>
    <p>
        My desire to be involved in each step of the process does not mean I like to micro-manage each of them and falling in the trap of my own biases. I strongly believe each team member
        should be involved and we can only benefit from the skillset of everybody.
    </p>
    <p>My journey at leading a team made of talented product designers, front-end developers and technical writers gave me the nuts and bolts of making design processes looking like seamless</p>
