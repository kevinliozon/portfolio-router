      Having a multi-disciplinary team working on a product or a project can come with some trade-offs.
      It might be due to a design process issue, a lack of decision making at certain checkpoints or the fact your people skillset is not being used adequately.
      This is where I can help you getting it right.

    <p class="c-block__info">
      Back to my student years I used to work as an on-site software support at the university hospital of Montpellier.
      Many of our interventions were related to staffs being confused by design choices rather than bugs.
      This made me realise the impact of design on the tools used by an organisation.
      Fast forward to today I have had the chance to work in various industries: from insuretech to eLearning among others.

      I have undergraduated in webdesign at the institute of technology of Montbéliard and postgraduated in management at the institute of business administration of Poitiers in France.
      In order to keeping up to date I follow the research results that are released by the <a class="c-link" href="https://www.nngroup.com/" target="_blank">Nielsen & Norman Group</a>.
