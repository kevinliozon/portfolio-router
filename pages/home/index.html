    Hi! I am Kevin Liozon and I look forward to get your product to the next level. The experience I have gathered at
    creating user-centred design systems and enabling design teams to grow within cohesive processes could be what you need.

  <h2>Looking for some help or input?</h2>

  <p>
    Having a multi-disciplinary team working on a product can come with some trade-offs.
    It might be a design process issue, a lack of decision making at certain checkpoints or the fact people's skillset is not being used adequatly.
    This is where I can help you getting it right.

    <h3>Need to optimise your design process?</h3>
    <p>
      This is often the root of many problems: from simple communication issues to not delivering as per requirements.
      I will show you how after several conversations with our product managers and designers at Fuse we managed to nail a process that works for us and the product.

    <p>
      It happens resources might not be affected to tasks relevant to their skillset. The effects may range from loss of quality
      to fear of accountability or worse, loss of motivation. I can help you to retain your best talents, unlock their hidden potential
      and mitigate the negative effects of change management via tools such as career ladders and team/individual OKRs.

    <h3>Aim to design a product with consistency and scalability in mind?</h3>
    <p>
      It is common sense getting things done properly from the start. Automatising tasks such as the creation of components or layouts
      and ensuring they are always consistent so you can safely reuse them can save you a lot of headaches and money in resources.
      I had the chance to work on the design system of several products and I can help you building yours with best practices in mind.

    <h3>Want to design and build a product with scalability in mind?</h3>
    <p>
      There is no overthinking in trying to get things done properly from start. It will turn out to be quite a relief on the long run indeed.
      One of the most exciting project I worked on was an insuretech IoT mobile application for Lloyds Banking Group and Halifax.
      Innovative projects especially can evolve in unexpected ways and we often have to deal with several trade offs.
    </p>
    <p>Here I will prove you how properly defining the user's need from the beginning paired with a consistent and device coherent design system can reduce these negative impacts.</p>

    <p>This project for BAE system below is slightly different but will show you how a solid design system can give you a head start even though the brand guidelines have not been provided by the client.</p>

    <h3>You have to go through a rebrand?</h3>
    <p>
      Wether it is an internal or a client rebrand, it always come with a set of constraints that would require compromise. It comes also with several opportunities
      to make up for past design mistakes and start anew with better standards of accessibility and design consistency at reach. However stakeholders will need to be convinced
      and this is what we will be looking at with those very specific cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Fuse, I got to work through some clients rebrands. Of course I am not going to list all of them but will focus instade on the most high stakes ones.
      Either because the user base was huge or because the client was a flagship one.

    <h3>Seeking for advices and support with at-risk clients?</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes a project does not go as expected: internal or client-related cross wiring, structural changes in the middle of the project scope, failed product education or implementation...
      There are multiple reasons why we end up sitting at a table with a confused or angry stakeholder, who either got sold something that did not exist or misunderstood what he was signing for.
    </p>
    <p>
      This kind of exposure taught me a lot about users' expectations. Far from the very codified and comfortable user testing interviews, we get to really connect with the client when the stakes are high.
      This is where sympathy transcends the concepts of empathy (sorry for the overused buzzword). The ability to not only understand what the user feel but also share the struggle.

  <h2>What about my commercial exposure?</h2>

  <p>
    I have been exposed to client-facing early in my designer's career. The challenge varied depending on the willingness of each
    to invest in UX in general however it is always great to see them eventually understanding the value and benefits of focusing
    on their users and accessibility.

    <h3>R&D projects for clients</h3>
    <p>
      Working with a client's R&D team sounds like a very specific situation, but being exposed to such one early in my career taught me a lot.
      The reason is the level of collaboration is at peak here: we can scramble with all the data available, can organise large scale user testings
      and release betas without concern.

    <h3>Industry exposure</h3>

    <p>
      I used to work in various industries, from insuretech to academic and learning platform passing by stints into the 3D printing world and IoT.
      My very first ambitious project was student one when me and two collaborators got tasked to create a content sharing platform for our university.
      Today I work in eLearning which feels like a return to my roots.

    <h3>Education</h3>

    <p>
      I have undergraduated in webdesign at the institute of technology of Montbéliard and postgraduated in management at the institute of business administration of Poitiers.
      Both diplomas are respectively recognised as bachelor and masters degree by the french ministry of education and both schools are public funded (entry exam for the latter).
      I have started studying in webdesign all the way back in 2012.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to keeping up to date I follow the studies that are released by the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/" target="_blank">Nielsen & Norman Group</a>
      (one of the most renowned authority in user research). I am also certified in webdesign and interaction Design by them and have also attended their courses
      in mobile design and UX management.

    <h3>How I got into UX</h3>

    <p>
      The first time I came to realise the impact of design on the tools used by an organisation was when I got hired to support medical staffs during
      the deployment of a new patient management system across the whole university hospital of Montpellier in France back in summer 2012.
      We were all assigned on site (making it easier for staffs to reach out to us) and most of the issues we had to help with were related to confusing design choices
      that made the user journey complicated rather than bugs.

    <h3>Activities</h3>

    <p>
      Being level 3 CMAS and level 1 PADI, scuba-diving is probably the activity that taught me the more. When diving, staying focused,
      keeping calm and looking constanstly after the people diving alongside you is critical. I have learnt that panicking only leads to bad decisions
      and that keeping a team involved is necessary in order to react efficiently in any situation. I also practice kendo but I still need to learn a lot here!

    <h2>Need to make your creative team's life easier?</h2>
    <p>
        My desire to be involved in each step of the process does not mean I like to micro-manage each of them and falling in the trap of my own biases. I strongly believe each team member
        should be involved and we can only benefit from the skillset of everybody.
    </p>
    <p>My journey at leading a team made of talented product designers, front-end developers and technical writers gave me the nuts and bolts of making design processes looking like seamless</p>
