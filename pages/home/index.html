      Having a multi-disciplinary team working on a product can come with some trade-offs.
      It might be a design process issue, a lack of decision making at certain checkpoints or the fact people's skillset is not being used adequatly.
      This is where I can help you getting it right.

    <p class="c-block__info">
      Back to my student years I used to work as an on-site software support at the university hospital of Montpellier.
      Many of our interventions were related to staffs being confused by design choices rather than bugs.
      This made me realise the impact of design on the tools used by an organisation.
      Fast forward to today I have had the chance to work in various industries: from insuretech to eLearning among others.
